# :snowman: cold

Stellar cold wallet app built in Go. Features:
* Building transactions (right now only native [payment](https://www.stellar.org/developers/learn/concepts/list-of-operations.html#payment)).
* Signing previously built transactions. :sparkles:
* Prints QR code with Transaction Envelope in console. :sparkles:
* You can run it on Raspberry Pi (and other ARM devices). :sparkles:

**Warning!** This tool is still in development. **Always** create your transaction for `test` network first and then check it in [xdr-viewer](https://stellar.github.io/xdr-viewer/). Then create your transaction for `public` network, check it again (!!!) and then submit it to the network.
